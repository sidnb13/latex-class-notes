\subsection{Defining Image and Kernel}

\subsubsection{Image}

Of a function, the set of vectors in the codomain hit by the domain.
The image of a function $f:\;\R^m\rightarrow \R^n$ is:

\[\boxed{
    \mathrm{Im}(f)=\{\vec{y}\in \R^n | \exists\;\vec{x}\in \R^m\text{ s.t. }f(\vec{x})=\vec{y}\}
}\]

Similar in concept to the range of a function in non-linear context.

\subsubsection{Kernel}

Srt of vectors in the domain that are mapped to $\vec{0}$ in the codomain.
Kernel of a function $f:\;\R^m\rightarrow \R^n$ is:

\[\boxed{
    \mathrm{Ker}(f)=\{\vec{x}\in \R^m | f(\vec{x})=\vec{0}\}
}\]

Analogous to the roots/zeros of a polynomial.

\subsection{Examples}

Following linear transformation's image lives in $\R^2$:

\[T(\vec{x})=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    1 & 1 \\
    -1 & 1
    \end{array}\right) \vec{x}\]

Following linear transformation's image forms a plane that is
$\R^2$:

\[T(\vec{x})=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    1 & -1 \\
    0 & 2 \\
    2 & 2
    \end{array}\right) \vec{x}\]

\subsection{Span}

If $A$ is an $n\times m$ matrix, then image of $T(\vec{x})=A\vec{x}$ is set of all vectors in $\R^n$
that are linear combinations of column vectors of $A$.\\

\noindent
Thus, the span of a set of $n$ vectors is all linear combinations of those vectors:

\[\boxed{
    \mathrm{span}(\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\cdots,\vec{v}_n)=\{\sum c_i\vec{v}_i | c_i\in\R\}
}\]

So the span of column vectors of $A$ is the image of the associated linear transformation.

\subsection{Kernel}

Kernel amounts to finding solutions to $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$. Kernels are closed under linear combinations.
Kernel can never be empty set, it always holds true that $T(\vec{0})=\vec{0}$.

\subsection{Invertible Linear Transformations}

Main conclusions about image and kernel:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Kernel is always (trivially) $\{\vec{0}\}$, else would imply dependance and therefore singularity in the associated matrix $A$
    so $\boxed{\mathrm{ker}(T)=\{\vec{0}\}}$
    \item Image is always the space $\R^n$ if associated matrix $A$ is $n\times n$, so $\boxed{\mathrm{Im}(T)=\R^n}$
\end{itemize}
