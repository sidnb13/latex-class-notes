\subsection{Definition in I/O space}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each item in output receives \textbf{at most} 1 input $\implies$ injectivity
    \item Each item in output receives \textbf{at least} 1 input $\implies$ surjectivity
    \item If \textbf{both conditions are satisfied} $\implies$ bijectivity
\end{itemize}

Invertibility is therefore synonymous with bijectivity.

\subsection{Conclusions}

Injectivity concludes that $\mathrm{rank}(A)=m$, where $A$ is $n\times m$. This is because
there must be a leading one in each column.\\ 

Surjectivity concludes that the last row in $\mathrm{rref}(A)$ is $0\;0\cdots 0\;1$.
Thus there must be no rows of 0 in $\mathrm{rref}(A)$, so all invertible matrices are square. Also
an invertible matrix is \textbf{nonsingular} and an invertible matrix is \textbf{singular}.
