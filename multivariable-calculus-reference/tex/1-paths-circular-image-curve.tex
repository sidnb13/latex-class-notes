\subsection{Unit Circle}

Unit circle is set of points in $\R^2$ defined as $C=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R} ^2|x^2+y^2=1\}$.
Has standard parameterization of $\vec{c}(t)=\big(\cos(t),\sin(t)\big)$.\newline 

\noindent Properties
\begin{itemize}
    \item Image of $\vec{c}$ is a closed curve (has no endpoints, plane is divided into $\geq 2$ disjoint regions)
    \item Image of $\vec{c}$ is a simple curve; no self-intersection 
    \item $\vec{c}(t)$ is an injective path; path is considered injective if $\vec{c}(t_1)=\vec{c}(t_2)$, which implies that $t_1=t_2$ where 
    these are on the open interval $(a,b)$ even if $a=b$
    \item Orientation of $\vec{c}$ is counter-clockwise in traversal
\end{itemize}
