\section{Linear Equations with Constant Equations}

\subsection{Auxiliary Equation}

Linear homogeneous DE with constant coefficients can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    a_{0} \frac{d^{n} y}{d x^{n}}+a_{1} \frac{d^{n-1} y}{d x^{n-1}}+\cdots+a_{n-1} \frac{d y}{d x}+a_{n} y=0
\end{equation}

Can be written in the form

\begin{equation}
    f(D)y=0
\end{equation}

where $f(D)$ is a linear differential operator. If the algebraic eqn $f(m)=0$
then we know $f(D)e^{mx}=0\implies y=e^{mx}$ is a solution to the form above.
$f(m)=0$ is the auxiliary equation associated with the DE.
Since the DE is of order $n$, the auxiliary equation is of degree $n$ with
roots $m_1,\ldots,m_n$.

Thus we have $n$ solutions $y_1=\exp(m_1x),\ldots,y_n=\exp(m_nx)$ assuming
the roots are \textbf{real} and \textbf{distinct} are then \textbf{linearly independent}.
The general solution is thus

\begin{equation}
    y=c_1\exp(m_1x)+\cdots+c_n\exp(m_nx)
\end{equation}

with arbitrary constants $c_1,\ldots,c_n$.

\subsubsection{Derivation}

We can say that $y^{(k)}$ is the $k$th derivative of $y$, so say the general form is

$$
a_ny^{(n)}+a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+a_1y^\prime +a_0y=0
$$

If we take $y=e^{rx}$, then observe $y^{(n)}=r^ne^{rx}$. So rewrite the general form as

\begin{align*}
    a_nr^ne^{rx}+a_{n-1}r^{n-1}e^{rx}+\cdots+a_1re^{rx}+a_0e^{rx}&=0\\
    a_nr^n+a_{n-1}r^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1r+a_0&=0
\end{align*}

Solving for the roots $r$ in this characteristic equation helps us obtain the general solution.

\subsection{Auxiliary Equation Repeated Roots}

Need method for obtaining $n$ linearly independent solutions for $n$ equal roots of auxiliary equation.
Suppose auxiliary equation $f(m)=0$ has $n$ roots $m_1=m_2=\cdots=m_n=b$.
Thus, the operator function $f(D)$ has a factor $(D-b)^n$. Want to find $n$ linearly independent $y$ for which $(D-b)^ny=0$.
Use the substitution $y_k=x^ke^{bx}$ such that

\begin{equation}
    (D-b)^n(x^ke^{bx})=0,\;k=0,1,2,\ldots,n-1
\end{equation}

The functions $y_k=x^ke^{bx}$ are linearly independent because the respective powers $x^0,\ldots,x^k$ are linearly independent.
So the general solution takes form

\begin{equation}
    y=c_1e^{bx}+c_2xe^{bx}+\cdots+c_nx^{n-1}e^{bx}
\end{equation}
