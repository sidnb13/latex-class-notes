\section{Quantifiers (Bonevac)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Aristotle logic gives arguments restricted form. Every sentence is of form $\{\text{some,all,no}\}F\{\text{are,not}\}G$
    \item Syllogistic argument has two such setences as premises and one as a conclusion. The meshing of these is specific, limited.
    \item \ti{Sentential logic} takes sentences as basic analytical units, covers broader realm.
    \item Sentential logic does not solve problems of syllogistic, e.g. cannot explain why an argument is valid
    \item Divergence b/w syllogistic and sentential resolved by Friege and Peirce
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduced determiners (e.g. all, some, no, every, any, etc.)
        \item Universal quantifier $\forall$ and existential quantifier $\exists$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constants and Quantifiers}

Atomic sentences consist of a main subject/noun phrase and verb phrase. Examples of verb phrases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item is a man
    \item sleeps very soundly
    \item kicked the ball into the end zone
\end{enumerate}

Verb phrases are terms in syllogistic logic, are \tb{true or false} of individual objects. E.g. a man can sleep soundly or not.
Objects of which verb phrase \tb{satisfy} it, phrase will \tb{apply} to them.
The set of objects which make a verb phrase true are called \tb{extensions}.

Verb phrases combine with noun phrases to form \ti{sentences}. Noun phrases specify an object or groups of objects, since verb phrases describe their truth values.
Following examples are complete sentences.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Socrates is a man
    \item Mr. Hendley sleeps very soundly
    \item Nate have Fred a copy of the letter
\end{itemize}

Upper-case alphabet letters w/wout subscripts are \tb{predicates}. Each predicate has an assigned number.
Predicate with number $n$ is $n$-ary. Predicate yields a truth value when combined with certain number of objects.
Assigned value $n$ indicates of how many objects the predicate takes on this truth value.

For example, man has singulary predicates (true false of a single object). Binary predicates take on two objects. Example is Person 1 respects Person 2, but Person 1 respects makes no sense.

To structure sentences, take example.

\begin{example}
    Something is missing
\end{example}

Missing applies to an object.

\begin{example}
    Missing(something)
\end{example}

We use lowercase letters to denote constants, capital for predicates as discussed.
Socrates is a man can be translated to $Ma$ where $a$ is a constant symbolizing Socrates, $M$ means man.

\begin{example} Translation\\
    (for some $x$)($x$ is missing)\\
    $\exists x M x$
\end{example}
